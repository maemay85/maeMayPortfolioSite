            <p>check check. is this thing on? oh it’s a text field? no? not even a form? just a static element on a static page? ok. well i’m not exactly prepared for this but uh…</p>

            <p>Hi my name is Mae May. Same sound, spelled different, kinda weird but it just worked out that way.</p>

            <p>I am a software engineer, designer, performing artist, operations expert, and just a real piece of work overall.</p>

            <p>Technology-wise I’ve worked primarily with full stack applications (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node JS), domain management, and I actually enjoy CSS, if you can believe that. </p>

            <p>My main goal within engineering - having over thirty years of experience playing, writing, and performing music on a bunch of different instruments - is to work on projects to improve and develop new music technologies, whether they are teaching tools, DAWs and plugins, or software for digital instruments. To that end I am currently learning C++ and poking around with an Arduino to get more familiar with electronics.</p>

            <p>I also simply love coding and am keenly interested in pursuing other projects and opportunities - so please don’t be shy, and drop me a line here!</p>
