            <p>Hi I'm Mae, and I love to build things!</p>

            <p>As a fullstack web developer, I find It quite thrilling to plan out an application from the backend to the front, write code, debug, debug, refactor, debug, debug again, and refactor once more, and then just like *magic* to deploy and have something out in the world that can actually help people.</p>

            <br/><br/><br/><br/>

            <p>Prior to coding, I ran a woodworking business and learned all kinds of things about working with clients, sketching out their ideas, creating a roadmap, and communicating the timeline with them, and working with a variety of components to bring the project into physical reality. It was actually this that prepared me for fullstack development - only now I'm working with code instead of, you know, wood. </p>

            <p>And of course, at heart, I am still and always will be an artist - and have extensive experience in music and dance performance and composition, and textile design and fabrication.  Again, I love to build things! </p>

        </ColumnContainer>
