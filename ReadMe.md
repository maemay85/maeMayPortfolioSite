Welcome to the portfolio website of me, Mae May (she/her)

This site serves primarily as a hub to route people to my various projects and engagements.

Currently, it is spun up with Vite and React SWC.

To run, cd into the directory and execute $npm install, and then $npm run dev

The overall plan is to gradually host the archives of my woodworking, my performance work, and certain coding projects that are more creative or demonstrative, and do not need their own separate website.

In the odd event that anyone is reading this as I work on the project, please know that I love feedback and suggestions! Don't be shy and holler at me at hellomaemay@gmail.com

Cheers,

Mae
